# The Gourd: A Sci-Fi Novel Series

A science fiction series exploring community, politics, and survival in the liminal spaces between empires.

## Series Concept

"The Gourd" is a 5-book sci-fi series centered on a space station that exists in the contested space between multiple interstellar powers. Inspired by the real-world Kowloon Walled City, the station serves as a unique community where residents have built their own informal governance, culture, and way of life despite—or perhaps because of—the jurisdictional ambiguity that surrounds them.

The station sits in the Meridian star system, strategically positioned at the crossroads of several major interstellar powers, each claiming sovereignty but none fully exercising control. This creates a fascinating setting where diverse groups of people must navigate external political pressures while maintaining the distinctive community they've created.

## Series Structure
